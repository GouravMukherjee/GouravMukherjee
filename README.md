## 🚀 About Me

I’m a **builder-first computer science student** who enjoys designing and engineering intelligent systems from the ground up.  
My interests sit at the intersection of **AI systems, automation, and scalable software engineering**.

I like working close to the metal *and* close to the user — from infrastructure and APIs to UX and product thinking.
